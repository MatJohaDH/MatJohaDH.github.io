I have long been of the opinion tha that blogs were 
for for narcissists and/or people that had something 
interesting to say. Having created this blog as a place
to write semi-random thoughts in the purpose of practicing 
writing, I guess that makes me a narcissist.

While I do not expect anyone to read this, or even find it nor 
look for it for that matter, it is a bit disconcerting to 
just upload something to the blogoshpere. 

Perhaps this is a bad idea.

Either way, experiments have to start somewhere.
