Working as a developer in humanities research I spend a lot of my 
time writing code to fetch, process and present different types of data.
It strikes me that writing code and writing text are in many ways
very similar, though the latter for some reason comes much harder to me.
Whereas I can easily get into a *flow* while solving tasks with code,
the hurdle for me to get into *flow* when writing.
There are several reasons for this, I am sure, but the biggest one is
probably that I do not practice it enough.


Enter this blog, which I intend to use as a motivaiton to keep practicing
writing at a semi regular interval.
